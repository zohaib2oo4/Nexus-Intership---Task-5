Project: SuperMarket Sales Prediction Pipeline

Description:
Developed a complete machine learning pipeline to predict supermarket sales. The project includes:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical features

Model training: Random Forest Regression with train/test split and full evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²)

Pipeline integration: Combined preprocessing and model into a single reusable pipeline

Model persistence: Saved trained pipeline using joblib

Prediction automation: Supports running predictions on new CSV datasets, with optional classification based on sales threshold

Outputs: Evaluation metrics in JSON and predictions in CSV.
